## Investor Research Report
*Australia & New Zealand's Premier Startup Investor Community*

## 1. What Is Innovation Bay?

Innovation Bay is Australia and New Zealand's leading community for technology founders and investors. Founded in 2003 and headquartered in Sydney, it has spent over two decades building the connective tissue of the ANZ startup ecosystem — bringing together entrepreneurs, angel investors, and venture capitalists through curated events, education, and deal flow.

The organisation operates on a core belief: a united, strong, and vibrant tech community leads to better outcomes for all participants. Its stated mission is to support startup founders on their journey from idea to IPO.

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Founded** | 2003 |
| **Co-founders** | Ian Gardiner & Phaedon Stough |
| **HQ** | Sydney, NSW, Australia |
| **Team** | ~22 employees |

### Four Community Pillars

Innovation Bay operates four distinct, curated communities — two for founders, two for investors:

| Community | Name | Who It Serves | Stage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Founders | **Canopy** | Founders & CEOs | Seed / Early Stage |
| Founders | **Summit** | Founders & CEOs | Series A+ |
| Investors | **Horizon ★** | Angel Investors, ex-Founders, HNWIs | Pre-seed to Series A |
| Investors | **Aurora** | Venture Capitalists, GPs | Series A+ |

### Ecosystem Partners

Innovation Bay partners with major institutions spanning finance, technology, and professional services:

- **Venture capital:** Blackbird, Airtree, Square Peg, OneVentures, Goldman Sachs
- **Technology:** Google Cloud
- **Capital markets:** Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)
- **Professional services:** Leading Australian law firms and financial service providers

The organisation is regulated as a Corporate Authorised Representative under Australian financial services law, and has received media recognition including features in Forbes Australia.

## 2. Horizon — The Angel Investor Network

Horizon is Innovation Bay's exclusive angel investor community, described as "not your typical angel network." It is built for experienced investors who want to go beyond passive deal flow and actively engage with founders and fellow investors in a high-trust, high-quality setting.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Members per location** | ≤ 25 |
| **Events per year** | 4× quarterly |
| **Curated deals per quarter** | 3 |
| **Investment rate (pitching founders)** | 30%+ |

### Membership Profile

Horizon is deliberately small and selective. Membership is open to:

- Experienced angel investors with a track record
- Exited founders seeking to deploy capital
- Senior executives and CEOs with relevant sector expertise
- High-net-worth individuals new to early-stage investing who want structured support

The group is capped at 25 members per city, keeping it intimate enough that all members can sit around one table and have a single conversation. This is a structural choice — not a constraint — reflecting a philosophy that depth of relationship matters more than scale.

### How It Works

**Deal Flow & Selection**

Horizon operates a dual-track investment model. Members can either access the full opportunity pipeline directly via a member investment platform, or rely on a selection committee to identify and recommend the top three investment opportunities per quarter. The committee presentation of curated founders happens at quarterly events — reducing time burden for busy investors while maintaining quality.

**Quarterly Events**

Each event follows a structured format: a sector deep-dive facilitated by a hand-selected panel of an exited founder, an active investor, and an industry expert, followed by introductions to the three founders selected for that quarter. Sectors covered have included AgTech, Healthtech, AI, Deep Tech, Fintech, B2B SaaS, Cybersecurity, and Impact Tech.

**Founder Screening & Support**

Horizon provides candid feedback to founders during the screening process and offers two pitch training sessions to those selected for presentation. This founder-friendly approach differentiates Horizon from networks that treat founders as deal flow rather than partners.

> **Member Quote:** *"Innovation Bay is done in the right spirits — everyone wants to help each other. I've built some really great relationships."*
> — Yash Varma, Empress Capital

> **Founder Quote:** *"Innovation Bay and Horizon supercharged my founder journey by connecting me with incredible mentors and investors, allowing me to raise $600K in a very short time period that would have otherwise taken 6–9 months on my own."*

### Track Record (2021 Snapshot)

In 2021, Horizon ran 8 pitch events featuring 49 founders across sectors including AgTech, Healthtech, AI, Deep Tech, and Impact Tech. More than 30% of founders who pitched received investments from Horizon members — a meaningfully high conversion rate for an angel group, reflecting the quality of curation.

## 3. Key People

> **Note:** Horizon does not publish its full member roster publicly — consistent with the private, exclusive nature of the community. The individuals below are those identified through public sources.

| Name | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ian Gardiner** | Co-founder, Innovation Bay | Co-founder since 2003 |
| **Phaedon Stough** | Co-founder, Innovation Bay | Co-founder since 2003 |

| **Michael Canaris** | Horizon Member | Cited at Darwin launch as NT-based member |
| **Martin Redhead** | Government Partner | Director of Business Innovation, NT Government; partnered on Darwin launch |

### Geographic Expansion

Horizon has been systematically expanding from its Sydney/Melbourne base to new Australian regions:

| Location | Year | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sydney / Melbourne | 2003 onwards | Original markets; core of the network |
| Adelaide | ~2021 | First B2B SaaS pitch day in March 2022 |

## 4. Relevance & Considerations

### Why Horizon Matters

Horizon is a high-signal investor community in the ANZ ecosystem. Unlike traditional syndicates or SPVs, it emphasises relationship depth over transaction volume. The ≤25-member cap per city and quarterly cadence mean that connections made through Horizon tend to be meaningful and recurring — this is not a networking event, it is a closed community.

The 30%+ investment conversion rate for founders who pitch is notably high for an angel group and reflects genuine quality filtering: founders go through screening, selection committee review, and pitch training before presenting.

### What We Don't Know

Horizon deliberately does not publish its full member list. This is standard practice for private investor communities but means we have limited visibility into the full roster. The publicly named members (Yash Varma, Michael Canaris) are likely a small fraction of the total membership across all cities.

### Geographic Momentum

The Darwin launch in September 2024, backed by the Northern Territory Government, signals that Horizon is actively scaling nationally with government support. This is both a validation of the model and an indicator that the network's reach will continue to expand — potentially making it a gateway to regional deal flow that larger VCs historically underserve.

### Recommendation

If Predelo has relevant exposure to the ANZ market — either as a potential target for partnership, investment, or distribution — Horizon warrants a closer look. The tight-knit community model and government backing give it institutional credibility. A direct outreach to Eleanor Salt (Community Manager) or engagement through Innovation Bay's apply-to-pitch process would be the most direct path to engagement.
